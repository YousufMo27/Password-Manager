# PassKeep

This is a password manager made with Python, SQL, and Tkinter GUIs which stores Passwords which users would like to save. There is also a login system to prevent anyone from accessing the information.



## To Get Started

Before running the program, you must first install a few python modules

```bash
  pip install tk
  pip install customtkinter
  pip install easygui
  pip install pyperclip
```
## How it works

After Running the program for the first time you will be taken to this screen

Once you have created the password you will be taken to this screen, on this screen you are given a key which
will provide you with the opportunity to change the password if you have forgotten it.
